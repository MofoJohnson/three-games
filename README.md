# three-games
Three folders, using html, css and javascript.

dice-challenge --> reload the page to get the result (it's 2 dice).

drum-kit --> has 7 instruments from a drum kit, uses buttons and keypress to create sounds.

simon-game --> click the right buttons for a sequence, has sounds.

I also use JQuery in the simon-game folder.
